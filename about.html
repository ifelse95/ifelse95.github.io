	<p>this my personal site. to present. to express myself. to do whatever i feel like, really. i update it whenever i can.</p>
	<p>my name is cyrus, aka ifelse95 or exuberantNoise. i am a 22 year old nonbinary college student (my pronouns are they/them) who likes to create and play when i have the energy to. i am a lesbian, taken by my beloved girlfriend. i am also mentally ill, neurodivergent, and have a chronic illness. if you look around, you might find out what. i'm also a taurus, if that matters to you?</p>
	<p>i like to make things, anything really. i mostly draw. sometimes i write. sometimes i make game edits and renders. i'm trying to code and stuff too. oh, and i love my ocs a whole lot! however, as mentioned before, i do these things when i have the energy to. i don't have much of that going around these days.</p>
	<p>i am currently studying web development and japanese at my local community college. i will be applying what i learn in my web development classes here on this site, too. also, if you see me writing in hiragana/japanese, im not a weaboo. im practicing. that being said, i do enjoy some japanese things.</p>
