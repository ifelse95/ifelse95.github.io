	<p>this my personal site. to present. to express myself. to do whatever i feel like, really. i update it whenever i can.</p>
	<p>my name is cyrus. i am 21 year old nonbinary person (my pronouns are they/them) who likes to create and play when i have the energy to. i am a lesbian, taken by my beloved girlfriend. i am also mentally ill and neurodivergent, and that is as much as i am willing to share on this page here. i'm also a taurus, if that matters to you?</p>
	<p>i like to make things, anything really. i mostly draw. sometimes i write. sometimes i make game edits and renders. i'm trying to code and stuff too. oh, and i love my ocs a whole lot! however, as mentioned before, i do these things when i have the energy to. i don't have much of that going around these days.</p>
	<p>i'm a beginner at HTML and CSS, so i hope my site isn't too unbearable. feel free to give feedback, but please be nice. i'm very sensitive. enjoy your stay!</p>
