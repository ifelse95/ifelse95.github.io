			<h2>About ifelse95</h2>
			<img src="img/misc/ifelse95s_true_origins.png" height="15%" width="15%">
			<p>ifelse95 is a <a href="https://morethanone.info/">plural system</a>. There is more info at the link, but essentially, we are multiple people sharing one brain and body.</p>
			<p>We have been plural for many years at this point, but at around 2019, our system went into dormancy. In May of 2023, the system came out of dormancy and members new and old alike came around. We also started forming out headspace more and more.</p>
			<p>Our system origin is currently a secret.</p>
			<h2>About this Site</h2>
			<p>ifelse95's house is supposed to serve as the main hub for all of our stuff. It is also here to provide information about our system.</p>
