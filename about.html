			<h2>About ifelse95</h2>
			<p>ifelse95 is a <a href="https://morethanone.info/">plural system</a>. There is more info at the link, but essentially, we are multiple people sharing one brain and body.</p>
			<p>We have been plural for many years at this point, but at around 2019, our system went into dormancy. In May of 2023, the system came out of dormancy and members new and old alike came around. We also started forming out headspace more and more.</p>
			<p>Our headspace started off as a single house, but has lately expanded into an island. The weather is usually pleasant, and the headspace is controlled by the very house that first appeared. Said house is sentient and can talk.</p>
			<p>If you would like to know our system origins, please send $50 USD to our paypal. (This is a joke, mostly. But if you do send money, I suppose we would have to tell you.)</p>
			<h2>About this Site</h2>
			<p>ifelse95's house is supposed to serve as the main hub that branches out into other sites. These sites may belong to other headmates, some may be communal. It is also here to provide information about our system.</p>
