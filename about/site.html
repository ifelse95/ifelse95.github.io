			<p>ifelse95's house was established around november 12th, 2020. it began firstly as a <a href="https://zonelets.net/">zonelets</a> site on <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities</a>.</p>
			<p>it began as a blog to talk about my thoughts, share ideas, document development of my projects, and more. then i started to add things like galleries and other pages. eventually, i realized that the zonelets format wasn't going to work for a fully fledged site, so i began to learn html and css properly and create a whole site.</p>
			<p>ifelse95's house is a personal website for sharing art, thoughts, collections, things we like, and more. it does not cater to anyone in specific, except to anyone who would like a glimpse into our soul. it is unapologetically loud, cringey, and carefree.</p>
			<p>this is our little corner of the web and we do as we please.</p>
			<p>ifelse95's house was hosted on our partner system's server, but it recently died. it briefly returned to neocities, before settling on github. the zonelets blog remains as a piece of this site, and is now called <a href="../zonelets/index.html">ifelse95's journal</a>.
