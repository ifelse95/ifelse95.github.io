			<p>i, the host, runs the majority of this site.</p>
			<p>my name is cyrus. i use they/them pronouns, my body is 23 year old, and my gender can be described as everything and nothing all at once. i am queer and polyamorous, taken by my two lovely partners (check out their sites at <a href="https://wertercatt.com/" title="wertercatt.com">wertercatt.com</a> and <a href="https://jingloria.wertercatt.com/dungeoncrashers/index.html" title="SBARGv2.5: Dungeon Crashers">SBARGv2.5: Dungeon Crashers</a>). i am the host of our system, i am mentally ill, and i am neurodivergent. i am also chronically ill. and a taurus, if that matters.</p>
			<p>i studied web development and web design briefly at my local community college, but i'm currently taking a break to focus on trauma recovery and my mental health. i am disabled and cannot work at this time. i live with my girlfriend and her family on planet earth.</p>
			<p>i consider myself to be a creative, but only when i have time, energy, and motivation. i create all sorts of things; art, stories, kandi bracelets, just to name a few things. my other hobbies include roleplaying, listening to music, collecting things, playing video games, and probably a few other things that i'm forgetting.</p>
			<p>i can be very shy and awkward, but im at least working on my shyness. i apologize if i am a little off-putting sometimes. i try my best to be kind and friendly.</p>
			<p>online, you can find me here and on <a href="https://ifelse95.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a>. feel free to follow me there.</p>
