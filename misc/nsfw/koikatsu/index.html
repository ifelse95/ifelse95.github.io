	<p>Welcome to my site for Koikatsu!/コイカツ！, a game I fairly enjoy!</p>
	<p>Here you will find mostly downloads of things I've created for the game, but you can also find galleries too.</p>
	<p>My downloads are intended to be used with the <a href="https://dl.betterrepack.com/public/" title="what? did you expect me to throw money at the same devs that made a game called r*pelay?">BetterRepack by ScrewThisNoise</a>. You can grab it at that link there.</p> 
	<p>Oh, and if you haven't realized it yet... <b>this site is inherently NSFW. You will find dirty things here. After all, it is a hentai game.</b></p>
	<p>Use the sidebar to navigate this site. There's no need for credit, just don't claim as your own and feel free to show me what you've made with my stuff.</p>
