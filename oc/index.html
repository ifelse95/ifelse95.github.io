        <h2>Welcome to ifelse95's OC Directory!</h2>
        <p>This site holds information on my original characters!</p>
        <p>There isn't much now, but this is brand new. Feel free to take a look around.</p>
        <div align="center"><img src="../img/divider0.gif"></div>
        <h2>Some Things to Note</h2>
        <p>Yes, you may draw my OCs! You don't even have to ask, just show me when you're done! SFW is always allowed, but I would prefer if you didn't draw NSFW of my OCs. At least check if they're an adult if you really want to go that route.</p>
        <p>I would prefer if you didn't write with my OCs. I'm kind of particular about characterizations. Sorry.</p>
        <p>Shipping OCs together is restricted to friends only. Sorry.</p>
        <p>And absolutely <b>NO</b> hateful or bigoted shit!</p>
        <p>Thank you! Feel free to explore using the header at the top of the page.</p>
