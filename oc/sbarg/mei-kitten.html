				<h2>Mei Kitten</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Mei is a Hepian from Kanjaweii, Planet Hepi, who found the members of SBARG after modifying her Cube Device's hardware to access foreign networks when she was younger. She used to use the chumhandle <font face="courier new">exuberantNoise</font> and the color <font color="#00c35e">#00c35e</font>, but now uses <font face="courier new">feverishUproar</font>. She has done work for the Capital City Laboratories in the Capital City, Planet Hepi in the past, but now works as her wife's secretary. </p>
				<h2>Background</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Born as the oldest (by five minutes) of a pair of twins, Mei grew up in Kanjaweii, AKA the rural village of flowers. Ever since she could remember, Mei had always been interested in space and what could be out there. In middle school, she took interest in the Planet Exploration division of the Capital City Labs, and ever since then worked hard to become eligible to work within that division. Mei did get accepted, and went to work there for several years.</p> 

<p>Before she was sent off on her first mission, Mei had modified her Cube Device's hardware after buying a chip off of someone selling various parts on the street for the equivalent of $5. This chip would let the device and the AI within the device, named ERII, connect to networks foreign to Planet Hepi. With this, she stumbled upon an application called Pesterchum and downloaded it. This eventually led her to contacting a memo called <font face="courier new">#The_Former_SBARG_Players</font> under the name <font face="courier new">exuberantNoise</font>. </p>
				<h2>Personality</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Mei is very friendly and outgoing. She typically maintains an upbeat and cheerful attitude most of the time. Mei cares about her friends and family dearly, and does her best to be as loving as she can. Although, because of this, she does tend to put others first before herself. Mei is also very smart and creative, along with having a knack for almost anything musical. However, she can be a bit too trusting and gullible. She can have a slight temper, as well, but mostly does a good job on maintaining it. Unfortunately, Mei also has an incredibly low self-esteem, and doesn't consider herself to be special in any shape or form. Once Mei becomes comfortable in a setting, an eccentric and slightly awkward side of her may come out.</p>
				<h2>Appearence</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Mei is 4 feet tall in height, has long, wavy turquoise hair, and pale blue skin with light orange, triangular markings. She has a single tail and six, pointed ears, three per each side of her head. She has one iridescent, purplish left eye and one blue and white bionic right eye, both with square pupils. </p>
				<h2>Powers, Skills, and Abilities</h2>
				<hr>
        <p>Mei currently does not have any powers.</p>

<p>However, she is very skilled in a lot of areas in music, including knowing how to play the guitar (Hepian, acoustic, electric, and bass) and drums, knowing how to sing, and knowing how to compose music. Mei also is a very good cook, taking after her mother Amaia.</p>

<p>Mei, like every other Hepian, has an ability called bond sense, which is a sort of heightened empathy for other Hepians and other life forms. Being an identical twin to Mai, her bond sense is much stronger with her brother, making it easy to tune into Mai's feelings. As for other typical Hepian abilities, Mei also has a great sense of hearing, and can easily mimic sounds and voices. Mei is also very strong and fast from working out and training from her previous job, as well as rather nimble.</p>
				<h2>Misc. Info</h2>
				<hr>
          <ul>
            <li>Mei used to have a habit of chewing on things. She still does, on an occasion.</li>
            <li>While on Earth, Mei played in a band with her brother Mai. They never got very famous, but they still had fun.</li>
            <li>Mei is a VOCALOID fan, and enjoys playing the <i>Hatsune Miku: Project Diva</i> series. She's not very good at it, though.</li>
            <li>Mei owns a New Nintendo 3DS XL, a PlayStation Vita, and a Nintendo Switch.</li>
            <li>If Mei had to pick a favorite ice cream flavor, it would be pistachio.</li> 
            <li>Mei prefers to often work out alone and in private if able. She gets a little nervous if there are people around. There is an exception with Mai, however.</li>
