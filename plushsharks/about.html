			<p>sadly, i am not a plush shark. i just collect them.</p>
			<p>my name is cyrus. i am 23 and my gender is all genders but also none of them at the same time. i use they/them pronouns. i am neurodivergent, queer, polyamorous, chronically ill, and the host of a <a href="https://morethanone.info/">plural system</a>. click the link to learn more.</p>
			<p>my hobbies include drawing, writing, roleplaying, gaming, writing code, collecting various items (mostly toys), listening to music, and more. my interests include dolls, plushies, sharks, food, a few different fandoms, video games, computers, technology, anime/manga, fashion, and a few other things.</p>
			<p>even though i'm human on the outside, on the inside i perceive myself as an android/alien thing. so i guess that's kinda what my sona is.</p>
			<p>i am pretty shy, but i'm trying to come out of my shell. this can make me very talkative and over friendly sometimes. i do apologize if i either seem to be at a 0 or at a 100.</p>
