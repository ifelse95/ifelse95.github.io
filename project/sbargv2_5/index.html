	<p>Welcome to my page on my involvement in SBARGv2.5!</p></div>
	<p><i>SBARGv2.5: Dungeon Crashers</i> is a post-session Homestuck roleplay, where characters from previous SBARG sessions and characters <i>not</i> from any SBARG session come together to take down dungeons planted into various places of the universe by an evil energy company by the name of Voidco.</p>
	<p>This part of my site will present things I have done for this roleplay, as well as the characters I play in this setting. A website more dedicated to SBARGv2.5 as a whole is currently in the works by my dear friend Nick! For now, you can check out this site by them;</p>

	<p>Check the side menu to look around this section. In addition to having my own characters in this setting, I have also written an OC biography template, created a speadsheet for hotel room availability on Desertia, and have done a bit of illustration.</p>
