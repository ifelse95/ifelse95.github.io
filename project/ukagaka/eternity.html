	  <p><i>Eternity is a runaway from a strange dimension of shape-shifters. Having wandered around different universes and dimensions, they have wound up on your computer! You can't help but to wonder... is your desktop an entire dimension of it's own? Regardless, it looks like they're here to stay.</i></p>
	  <p>Eternity is an Ukagaka (伺か, or ghost) developed using <a href="https://zichqec.github.io/s-the-skeleton/xtemplate">Zichqec's X. Template.</a></p>
