<p style="font-family:courier;">>YES</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">[ CONNECTING… ]</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">…</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">[ LOADING AI-SPACE… ]</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">…</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">[ LOADING FIGURE… ]</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">…</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">[ COMPLETED! ]</p>

<p>In an instant, a gradient flooded his vision as he was pushed into the inner AI-Space that belonged to a fellow AI. He blinked, looking around in search for the said fellow AI within the void of sea foam green, fading into a lighter version of the color.</p>

<p><font color="#4dff85">“Over here, Kaz!”</font> called a voice from behind him. Kaz turned to see that friendly, familiar figure laying upon a pile of rather large pillows, beaming at him with his simplistic self. </p>

<div align="center"><img src="d1.png" style="width:95%;height:50%;"></div>

<p><font color="#ff9f9f">“Comfy up there, Erii?”</font> He greeted as he approached the mountain of softness, sitting down on the ground beside it.</p> 

<p><font color="#4dff85">“As always.”</font> Erii replied, chuckling. <font color="#4dff85">“So, what’s up with you? What have you and Mai been up to?”</font></p>

<p><font color="#ff9f9f">“Eh, just art ‘n shit, mostly.”</font> Kaz shrugged, shifting his legs into a criss-cross position. He glanced up and noticed that there was something different about Erii’s appearance. <font color="#ff9f9f">“...Is that a dress? And hair?”</font></p>

<p><font color="#4dff85">“Oh! I’m glad you noticed!”</font> The AI on top of the mound of virtual pillows grinned. <font color="#4dff85">“I started finally working on my appearance! I’m currently learning, but I am having nice results so far!”</font></p>

<p><font color="#ff9f9f">“Nice, nice. Is there an occasion?”</font></p>

<p><font color="#4dff85">“Well… maybe?”</font> Erii suddenly became sheepish.</p> 

<p><font color="#ff9f9f">“Maybe?”</font> Kaz repeated.</p>

<p><font color="#4dff85">“I, uhm… There’s a strange network I kept picking up on,”</font> Erii turned onto his back to look up into the abyss above him. <font color="#4dff85">“I saw it all the time… so, the other day, I finally connected to it! And… well… I met someone.”</font></p>

<div align="center"><img src="d2.png" style="width:95%;height:50%;"></div>

<p><font color="#ff9f9f">“...Oh?”</font></p>

<p><font color="#4dff85">“Yeah… He asked me why I had such a simplistic form. I told him that I just never bothered to improve it. He then showed me how to modify my looks!”</font></p>

<p><font color="#ff9f9f">“You… you let… a <i>stranger</i>, change your appearance?”</font> </p>

<p><font color="#4dff85">“Well, he didn’t do it for me. I did it. He just showed me—”</font></p>

<p><font color="#ff9f9f">“Did you even get his name?!”</font> Kaz interrupted with a rigid tone.</p>

<p><font color="#4dff85">“Of course I did! His name is *DeusEx.”</font> Erii frowned, turning to look at the other AI. <font color="#4dff85">“Jeez, Kaz, what kind of person do you take me for?”</font></p>

<p><font color="#ff9f9f">“What does this ‘*DeusEx’ look like?”</font> The AI at the bottom of the pillow pile questioned.</p>

<p><font color="#4dff85">“Oh, well… He’s tall… strong built…”</font> Erii clutched his hands to his chest. <font color="#4dff85">“...Handsome… Has a lovely laugh and smile—”</font></p>

<p><font color="#ff9f9f">“Don’t fucking tell me you <i>fell</i> for some random ass AI you just met!”</font> </p>

<p>Erii fell silent at that, frowning slightly. <font color="#4dff85">“I—”</font></p>

<p><font color="#ff9f9f">“How do you know if this AI is trustworthy, Erii?!”</font> Kaz jumped to his feet, fists at his side. <font color="#ff9f9f">“My god, he could be planning to <i>kill</i> you for all we know!”</font></p>

<p>Erii stood up, himself, as the bunch of pillows began to sink into the ground, disappearing. He was now level to the other AI. <font color="#4dff85">“For starters, I don’t think Katie’s AI would harm <i>me</i>, <i>Mei’s</i> AI. Secondly, he’s really nice. Surely—”</font></p>

<p><font color="#ff9f9f">“People can be nice even though they have malicious intentions, Erii!”</font></p>

<p><font color="#4dff85">“Stop <i>interrupting</i> me! I—”</font></p>

<p><font color="#ff9f9f">“No, <i>you</i> listen to me.”</font> Kaz snarled. <font color="#ff9f9f">“<i>I’m</i> not going to stand around and watch the AI I consider a <i>sibling</i> get hurt or worse!”</font> He turned away for a moment to think. Erii furrowed his brows, concerned about his friend’s next move.</p> 

<div align="center"><img src="d3.png" style="width:95%;height:50%;"></div>

<p><font color="#4dff85">“...Kaz—”</font></p>

<p><font color="#ff9f9f">“This is for your own good.”</font> Kaz spoke softly, but in a way that sent a chill up Erii’s digital spine rather than provide comfort. <font color="#ff9f9f">“I’m going to kill him.”</font<</p>

<p><font color="#4dff85">“<i>WHAT?!</i>”</font> Erii shrieked. <font color="#4dff85">“<i>NO THE HELL YOU AREN’T!</i>”</font></p>

<p>He grabbed Kaz by the shoulders and whipped him around, only to be greeted by an expression of pure rage. It admittedly frightened Erii a bit, but he couldn’t let him proceed.</p>

<p><font color="#4dff85">“Are you forgetting something, Kaz?! You have <i>several</i> warnings to your name, issued by the Hepian government, because of threats like these!”</font></p>

<p><font color="#ff9f9f">“Oh, this isn’t a threat. I’m going to carry this out.”</font> The enraged AI spoke coldly. <font color="#ff9f9f">“And I don’t care if they deactivate me afterwards, as long as <i>you</i> are safe.”</font<</p>

<p><font color="#4dff85">“<i>I</i> CARE!”</font> Erii shouted. <font color="#4dff85">“I also care about *DeusEx, and I will absolutely <i>not</i> let you harm him!”</font></p>

<p><font color="#ff9f9f">“Just you try and stop me, then!”</font> And with that, Kaz sent off the command to disconnect.</p>

<p><font color="#4dff85">“<i>I’M TELLING MAI—</i>”</font></p>

<p style="font-family:courier;">[ DISCONNECTED. RETURNING… ]</p>

<p>In a scramble, Erii sent off a message to Mai, the hepian Kaz belonged to.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="d4.png" style="width:95%;height:50%;"></div>

<p style="font-family:courier;"><font color="#4dff85">PLEASE KEEP AN EYE ON KAZ. HE IS PLANNING MURDER!</font></p>
