      <p>this is a blog made with zonelets, used for more long-form thoughts and documentation.</p>
	  <p>this blog is a part of ifelse95's house, which is ran by Cyrus, a mentally ill and neurodivergent enby with too much time on their hands and not enough energy for anything half the time.</p>
	  <p>this is actually how the site first started off, as a zonelets blog! but now, i've decided to expand upon my site with more things.</p>
	  <p>enjoy your stay!</p>
