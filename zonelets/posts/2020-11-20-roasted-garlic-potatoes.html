      <p>so, last night, i was thinking about some potatoes my girlfriend's mom made the other night. they were garlicky, and just overall very good. i started craving them, so i took to pinterest to see what i could find. well, i found this;</p>

      <p>today, i went ahead and made it. i was nervous about it, to be honest. im not a very good cook, as i have very little experience. but i went ahead and followed the video the best i could. i finished them a bit early because i could smell the butter starting to burn. i must of had the oven up too high.</p>
      <p>they were good! i expected them to be a little softer, but they weren't bad at all. i let my girlfriend's mom try them as well, and she really liked them too! i consider this a personal success, to be honest. i wish i could of made more, but i figured a small batch would be safe for testing purposes.</p>
      <p>anyways, that's that i guess. here's something ive been listening to today.</p>
