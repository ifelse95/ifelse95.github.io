      <p>it's been a very sleepy week. it seems like i just sleep through the day, and then i'm up and about at night. which sucks, because it gets quiet at night.</p>
      <p>well, lately while i am awake, i've been playing a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku:_Project_DIVA">Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA.</a> mostly Project DIVA F and Project DIVA F 2nd. i've also picked up <a href="https://projectdxxx.me/">Project Project Dxxx</a> just last night</p>

      <p class="caption">pictured above is a gif from actual footage of mine, me being sabotaged by my controller. thankfully, we got a new one since then.<p>
      <p>i'm no good at these games at all... especially PPD. XD but, i'm learning! and i'm having fun. ever since i was a kid, i wanted to play project diva. and now, i get to! :D</p> 
      <p>i don't see myself becoming like, a god at rhythm games or anything. my brain is a little too foggy for that. instead i just wish to play the best i can and just have fun with it. thats all! C:</p>
      <p>as for other things lately... a major holiday is approaching, and its messing with me a little. my symptoms always worsen around this time of year, but i'm just trying to do what i can to stay busy. in addition to project diva, i've also been playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomodachi_Life">Tomodachi Life</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD:_Dream_Emulator">LSD: Dream Emulator</a>. i have also been drawing a tiny bit, i actually finished a drawing for one of my best friend's birthday tonight. but, again, it's mostly been sleeping from me. it's been so rainy this week.</p>
      <p>i think that wraps it up for me! i hope anyone reading this has a good thanksgiving, if they celebrate. tonight i was listening to this vaporwave mix. i recall listening to it before, also on a rainy, stormy day...</p>
