      <p>i hope everyone had a good thanksgiving, if you celebrate. turns out, we arent celebrating ours until tomorrow (or... later today, rather. it's currently the 27th here.)</p>
      <p>oh well.</p>
      <p>anyways... i'm getting much more familiar with neocities, fiddling (not really entirely writing) with html/css/js/etc, zonelets and such. i'm starting to slowly share this site with more people, giving a warning for its flashiness of course. they can take it or leave it, i dont really mind either way.</p>
      <p>ever since i was a kid, i wanted a website. i remember telling my mom, and all she said to me was that i would need to buy a domain. not much encouragement or anything, so i didn't get to do anything until now. plus, by the time i was actually just starting to fiddle with HTML, the original geocities was already gone.</p>
      <p>that... sort of explain why my site is the way it is now ^^;</p>
      <p>anyways, so since i'm already going ham, i think i've decided to have this site as a sort of personal space for myself. i'm pretty sick of social media lately, so perhaps this is my transition off to something else. i was originally gonna use this place for documenting about my projects and the like. i will still do that, of course! but just know there will be more of <i>me</i> here, too.</p>
      <p>soon, i think i will talk a little bit about one of my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukagaka">Ukagaka</a> projects, named Eternity. i've been working on them off and on, mostly off unfortunately. 2020 has been a horrible year for my creative drive, but i suppose that's only natural considering the State of the World.</p>

      <p class="caption">i made this and realized how many empty gaps the shell had... thank goodness i'm planning to redo it sometime in the future</p></div>
      <p>i think that's it for now. this song has been stuck in my head lately. stay safe out there!</p>
