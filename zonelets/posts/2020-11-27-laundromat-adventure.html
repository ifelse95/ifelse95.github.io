      <p>the universe must want to kill me today. just today, i've twisted my ankle, hit my head upon entering a car, and just now accidently tried to inhale water.</p>
      <p>or, i must just be clumsy. yeah, let's say that.</p>
      <p>our washing machine door wont close! and prior to that, it was already having issues actually trying to get through a cycle. so we do our laundry at the local laundromat. its not ideal for the most part, considering the State of the World, but i do like going.</p>
      <p>me and my girlfriend went together. after putting our clothes in, we sat and chatted. my thing right now is... well. *gestures at website* this. and my girlfriend started her own site, so i asked her what she had in mind for her site. we also talked about other things, like social media, memes, what was playing on the tv in the laundromat, etc.</p>

      <p>above are some doodles i did while i was waiting for our laundry. a self portrait and hatsune miku nt. my girlfriend suggested i draw miku, so i did! its strange, she's technically not a vocaloid anymore. i'm still not entirely sure what all NT entails, but i am looking forward to it as a singing synth fan.</p>
      <p>i also took a selfie, and that will go into my about section soon enough. it will probably be heavily processed in some way or another though. i don't want to completely reveal what i look like.</p>
      <p>anyways, more laundromat stuff. there was a person who might of been around our age, and they were playing with a deck of cards. i wanted to talk to them about their cards, because i actually collect cards myself, but i was too shy. then, there was an older person who was very chatty. they seemed to know the employees at this particular laundromat well.</p>
      <p>that's the thing with this place in particular. i've been to laundromats before, but that was back in my hometown. back there, everyone seemed so stand-offish. but here? everyone is so easy to talk to, and very nice. it kinda feels like a family, as corny as that sounds lol.</p>

      <p class="caption">i forgot i had my tangle in my bag! here's a picture.</p></div>
      <p>anyways, we're home now and will be having dinner later. i am currently in a rather festive get-up of wintery penguin pajama pants and a christmas-y polar bear shirt.</p>
      <p>...my ankle is gonna be seriously fucked up tomorrow. i took ibuprofen to stop the pain, but ive been walking on it all day, and it doesnt feel right. whoops, lol.</p>
      <p>that's all from me right now. two posts in one day... here's a song i've been vibing to. i love mili, one of my favorite groups.</p>
