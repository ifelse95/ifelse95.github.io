      <p>i was saying that i wanted a separate device of some sort to learn linux with kind of casually to my friends earlier this evening. initially i said something like a cheap laptop. one of my more technologically-minded friends suggested a raspberry pi.... and that made me remember, <i>hey! i actually </i> have <i>one of those!</i></p>

<p>so i whipped this mess up together. unfortunately, the only SD card i had was a 4 gb one.... somehow i will need to obtain a bigger one. ^^;</p>
<p>but hey, at least it works! i got this thing back in senior year of high school, in one of my tech classes. my teacher gave us each a raspberry pi and... i actually don't recall what were supposed to do with them. you see, before the year ended, my teacher quit. i don't even know if i was supposed to return this thing or not</p>
<p>well, it's mine now i guess. i will take good care of it.</p>
<p>anyways... i hope no one is trying to view my site on a raspberry pi 3 model b+... because it is very <i>NOT</i> optimized for it! XD</p>
<p>hmm.... yes, now a song. give me just a second... ah, here we are.</p>
