      <p>i am drafting this at 6:45 AM <sub><sub>(and revising at 10 pm! oops...)</sub></sub>, as i've been awake for two hours now thanks to a psychotic episode… (if you've read my about, you will know that i am schizophrenic.) but let's not worry about that. i wanna talk about my day yesterday to distract myself. forgive me now, as this post won't have any pictures... ^^;</p>
<p>so yesterday was one hell of a day. the longest day i've had for a while. me, my girlfriend, and her mother went to the laundromat again, and then christmas/yule shopped.</p>
<p>we had more laundry than usual to take care of yesterday, so we were there for a little while. maybe 2 hours? and it was pretty quiet too. unfortunately, our favorite big washers were in use by someone else at the time, so we had to use like… 4 small washers lol.</p>
<p>i didn't take my medicine yesterday, so i had less brain cells than usual. my girlfriend and i talked about how you could get the chairs that rumble and shit in movie theatres in the comfort of your own home… for a price of thousands of dollars per chair, <i>PLUS</i> a yearly $90 subscription to use the goddamn thing. i just said that they're best and cheaper to experience in a movie theatre, anyways.</p>
<p>then we talked about our phones being… bleh. her's is newer than mine, but she has had to replace the screen in the year she's had it, amongst other things (and has to replace it again!). her speakers are also not working. meanwhile, mine is some very low-end model that ive had for 3 years or so, and half of the screen is absolutely shattered. the sim card also keeps disconnecting and is overall just a piece of junk... </p>
<p>we talked about other things, but i cant really remember what right now… eventually we finished laundry, and then we headed off to do christmas shopping. not the most ideal thing, but we played it as safe as we could.</p>
<p>at the first place we went to, i got what was perhaps an early christmas/yule present; a pair of boots. i havent worn boots in such a long time, i love them. they fit my feet perfectly. we also got some other things, such as iridescent silverware. ...yeah not much else to say on that, we now own very pretty forks and knives and shit.</p>
<p>we also got gift wrap, tape, scissors, all that jazz. my girlfriend apparently purchased a gift for me while we were at it, and her and her mother did everything they could to prevent me from seeing it… i saw it, but i forgot what it was. i told my beloved, "dont worry about it, i will forget between now and then." and i did.</p>
<p>then we went to the mall… my <i>god</i> was it busy. made me nervous as hell! thankfully our only stop there was Hot Topic. and they were letting in only a small number of people into the store.</p>
<p>so when it's our turn to head in, me and my girlfriend separate to find gifts for each other. Hot Topic, this one in particular at least, is a rather small store… so that was fun lol. at one point my girlfriend was in the same place i wanted to look and i turned to her and said "_____, banish yourself!" ...the cashiers got a laugh out of that, which im glad for. we can all use a laugh nowadays.</p>
<p>im not gonna tell what i got my girlfriend… because she reads my posts!</p>
<p>anyways, we finished our shopping and head back home. we grab dinner on the way. once we make it home, we have to haul everything in, laundry included. at this point, it felt like my bones were dissolving! so that was fun. after that, we eat and me and my girlfriend separate to wrap our presents for each other.</p>
<p>and after all that!!! i finally rested. phew! definitely the longest day ive had in a long time… but it was fun.</p>
<p>yeah, that's all i wanna talk about ^^; better than nothing, i suppose. i've been playing even more project diva lately, and i've been having this song stuck in my head lately. as always, thank you for reading and stay safe out there!</p>
