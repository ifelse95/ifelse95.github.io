	  <p>next week, it will be yule and christmas time. and for some reason, this year... i'm super, super excited!</p>
	  <p>well... maybe not so much for some reason. i don't know. 2020 has been a shit-tastic year for everyone, myself included. on top of that, winter is now approaching, and winter time is very hard on my mental health. maybe you could guess that from my last post, where i mentioned i was having a psychotic episode?</p>
	  <p>anyways, with these factors in play, i must find something to look forward to each day or i will become unwell... and, well, i guess that would be the holidays! the holidays and i usually have a somewhat complicated relationship... but i've come to realized that is because of the times where i would have to go out and see family. or in this case since i've moved away from my home state, my girlfriend's mom's side of the family, who we do <i>not</i> vibe with, and they do not vibe with us.</p>
	  <p>well, see, the thing is... because of the plague, we will not be seeing this side of the family this year! it will just be us. and, well, i guess that eases things up a bit, because now i'm <i>super</i> excited about the holidays. it is something to look forward to! minus having to see family you don't vibe with, the holidays usually give me a warm feeling inside my heart... and i know that sounds super corny! but it's true. and i couldn't explain why...</p>
	  <p>my only concern is what i will do after christmas... what will i look forward to next to get me by? maybe my roleplay group. i do have a few things planned in terms of plot for that.</p>
	  <p>i hope you guys are hanging in there. i'm doing my best. i think that's all we can do right now, and that's okay. here's a fun song i like to listen to, to cheer me up. stay safe out there you guys.</p>
