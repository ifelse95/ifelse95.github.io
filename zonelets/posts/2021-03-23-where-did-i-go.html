      <p>its been... about two months. hi again.</p>
	  <p>to make it brief, i was severely sturggling with my mental health. but, i made it out alive, and i'm doing much better lately. at some point during my extremely low period, i had put up a page stating that this site was under indefinite hiatus. im not sure if anyone saw that, but it doesn't matter now, the site is back up. i think i'm ready to get back into writing again.</p>
	  <p>i've got a few topics in mind, i'll sort that out later. it will just be same usual diary-esque sort of thing, just... talking about things on my mind.</p>
	  <p>things might be slower at first, maybe from here on out indefinitely. i'm trying to not pressure myself into doing things. and life has been a lot calmer that way. however, i am a bit understimulated...</p>
	  <p>anyways, point is, i had taken a break, and i think im ready to start doing things here again. slowly, but surely.</p>
	  <p>speaking of slowly... here's our song for this post. i hope you've all been doing well.</p>
