      <p>hi! this is a fresh start!</p>
	  <p>for those who may be new (probably all of you?), this zonelets blog used to be a sort of personal thing. where i would talk about my thoughts and such... well. that was kinda hard to do.</p>
	  <p>you see, while i do love talking, it does use up a lot of energy. and to keep updating a blog with personal ramblings... i got burnt out very quickly. so, i am repurposing this site. i also switched hosts. my girlfriend, wertercatt, recently set up a home web server. she was generous enough to let me host my site on it. someday though, i shall get a domain...</p>
	  <p>anyways, from now on, this blog will mostly focus on me talking about the things im working on. whatever that might be. i like doing all sorts of things, so content will vary.</p>
	  <p>my current project at the moment is... my website! yes. i'm kinda dipping my toes further into HTML and CSS, after being inspired by my friend's site (which you can find <a href="http://jingloria.wertercatt.com/lostpawns/">here!</a>). i think it's going well... the main page is kind of funky, but it could be worse. i did just start writing CSS a day or two ago... @_@</p>

	  <p>i drew an old oc of mine just for that UNDER CONSTRUCTION graphic. i thought she would be fitting. i do miss my other ocs sometimes...</p>
	  <p>well, that's it from me! have you been listening to any good music lately? let me know... the music i have is getting kinda stale... but my friend linked me this banger recently. take care!</p>
