      <p>i really havent been working on much as of lately, if im gonna be real honest. my mental health has taken a nose dive, to a point where it landed me in the emergency room a few days ago. so i'll talk a little bit about what i've been having trouble with on this site...</p>
	  <p>and that is the <a href="http://ifelse95.wertercatt.com/gallery/art2021.html">art gallery</a>. see, i took the one from w3schools and edited it a little bit. i know, im so original. but if anything, it's looking like a temporary solution at the moment.</p>
	<p> it works... under a few conditions. each image it displays has to be the same size, or the layout will be thrown off. this calls for me to have to make preview images for each piece of art, taking up more room on the server (my girlfriend and my webhoster, <a href="http://wertercatt.com/">wertercatt</a>, tells me not to worry but all i know how to do is worry). secondly, the titles for each one cant be too long, or that <i>too</i> will throw off the layout. thirdly, for a gallery that is supposedly responsive, it doesn't play nice on mobile. again, the whole layout is thrown off.</p>
	<p>*sighs* im not nearly skilled enough to figure this out... i may have to return to my previous solution of putting a gallery on my site. which sucks because it felt really out of place. i havent had the energy to really look into this further, im not trying to be lazy. i hope you can forgive me.</p>
	<p>also, somehow ive managed to leave the link to the 2021 gallery labeled as 2020... *facepalm*</p>
	<p>i hope y'all are staying safe and staying sane out there. i've been listening to a lot of hyperpop lately... i was gonna put in some hyperpop, but i feel like this vocaloid classic suits my mood more today.</p>
