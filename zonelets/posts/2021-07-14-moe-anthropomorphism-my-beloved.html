      <p>when i was a kid, i couldnt draw anything other than humanoids very well. i mean, it still kind of applies to me now but im a lot better about it these days.</p>
	  <p>anyways, what i would do when i was presented with something or someone that wasnt human was create a humanization based on the original look. when i was a bored 12 year old, i humanized my Nintendo DSi and my MP3 player. i also humanized lego minifigs. some non-human cartoon characters. unfortunately, i have lost these designs, so i cant show you them. although, they're probably kinda embarrassing...</p>
	  <p>i've known that this way of doing things was called "<i>Moe</i> anthropomorphism," or <i>moe gijinka</i> (萌え擬人化) or just gijinka. i just never used those terms much until recently. basically, you take anything that isnt human(oid) and make it into a pretty or cute human(oid). usually based on various details of the original design. you can read more on this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe_anthropomorphism">wikipedia article</a>.</p>
	  <p>of course i ate this shit up, i love drawing pretty and/or cute human(oid)s, and i loved looking at them too! some examples that come to mind immediately would be OS-tans, or Wikipe-tan.</p>

	  <p>so. this is my latest fixation. gijinka.</p>
	  <p>i've taken on a small project of designing my own based off my small handheld gaming console collection. i've humanized my PlayStation Vita and Nintendo DS Lite so far. initially deisgned in Koikatsu*, but i've doodled them a few times as well.</p>

	  <p>this is kinda a newly rediscovered indulgence of mine. its probably cringy or whatever but im getting to a point where i just dont really care anymore. i'm remaking my DSi from my childhood at the moment, but i haven't had a source of caffeine lately like i did with my Vita and DS Lite. so im a little sluggish there. i've also considered making a humanization of my own website. i mean, why not? its <i>my</i> webbed site. im completely free here.</p>
	  <p>so, that's what ive been working on lately. i don't think i'll really give these characters a story or anything? not at the moment. im just having fun making deisgns. i am trying to figure out some personalities however. not sure where im going with those yet.</p>
	  <p>wow, if you actually read this... thank you. here's some music for you. do take care and stay safe out there.</p>
