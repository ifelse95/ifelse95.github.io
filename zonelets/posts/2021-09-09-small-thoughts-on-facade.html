      <p>you know... that one game everyone kinda meme'd on? with "melons" and such.</p>
	  <p>i played that game again tonight for the first time in years. you can find my gameplay in video form below.</p>
	  <div align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QM7PVJuWVYM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
	  <p>Façade is a game that had always fascinated me, but also kind of made me feel bad at the same time. and that's why i admire it. i'm a bit saddened by the fact that it is probably only known because it was meme'd on so hard. i never really saw anyone try to seriously play the game.</p>
	  <p>i guess it's not so bad that videos of popular youtubers at the time being dumb in the game is what brought it to people's attention, but i kind of feel like it pulls away from the fact that this is an impressive game. i'm not stoping anyone from being silly with the game, by all means go ahead. even i've done some silly things in this game. but you have to acknowledge that this game is very neat.</p>
	  <p>more related to my own gameplay above, you might of seen that in the end, trip and grace sort of did a 180. this really caught me off guard, i had never had this happen to me before. they both then politely kick me out, which was something else i've never seen or experienced before. it was kind of unnerving.</p>
	  <p>also, for the record, i think trip is an asshole. i was trying to side with grace, but i guess the AI didn't really catch that.</p>
	  <p>that's all i have to say for right now. i hope you've been doing okay. stay safe out there.</p>
