      <p>this is a sort of <a href="https://ifelse95.tumblr.com/post/663366727918403584/so-i-made-this-post-earlier-this-month-i-talked">cross-post</a> from my less-professional tumblr.</p>

	   <p>earlier this month, i made the post above. since then, i've talked to my therapist about this predicament, and she told me something that i probably kind of knew already inside but needed to hear out loud anyways.</p>
	   <p>she told me that she understood where i was coming from, and that a lot of people also struggle with their mental health a lot during this time of year. however, she suggested a change in perspective.</p>
	   <p>she said this change would by all means would <i>not</i> happen overnight, but to actively dread and worry about fall and soon following winter is going to prime me to just feel bad already and much more easily. she suggested i find things that i can get excited about these seasons, so i can look forward to them and feel better about the seasons. and over time... i did find things to be excited about. </p>
	  <p>it didnt happen overnight, just as i was told. but something slowly shifted from when i started off with begrudgingly suggesting that i could be excited for halloween and samhain to my therapist, not really welcoming the idea of changing my view on things. i found tiny things to be excited about each day, all up until one day, i was just incredibly excited for fall as a whole.</p>
	  <p>and i hope to do the same with winter. autumn, i am sorry i was so bitter. i am ready for warm sweaters, cinnamon scented days, apples and hot tea while regaining my love for reading.</p>
	  <p>i'm reading <i><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13376.The_House_of_the_Scorpion">House of the Scorpion</a></i> by Nancy Farmer again, by the way. i first read this book for class in 7th grade, and enjoyed it so much i asked for it and it's sequel, <i><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17063696-the-lord-of-opium">Lord of Opium</a></i>, for my 14th birthday. it hits much differently now that i am an adult. also, i've been slacking on providing my "suggested listening" (aka songs i am enjoying currently and just really want to share). so here is this by mili. give more of their music a listen, you wont regret it.</p>
