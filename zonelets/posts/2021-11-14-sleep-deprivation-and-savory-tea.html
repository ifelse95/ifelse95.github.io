	  <p class="caption">one of my favorite mugs, my maneki-neko mug.</p></div>
	  
	  <p>long time no see. i've been through it, but things a looking up a little bit.</p>
	  <p>it's close to 7 am at the start of writing this. i've been up since 2 pm yesterday, with a nap somewhere in between. yesterday, i went to the asian market.</p>
	  <p>i've always loved asian markets. not only for the nice snacks, but also because there's so much to see. this particular one is the coolest i've been to so far. i actually got my maneki-neko mug there, too, a year or two ago.</p>
	  <p>i got some pretty good stuff. matcha kit kats, matcha pocky, matcha (did you know i like matcha?) and taro flavored bubble tea in cans... as well as white peach calpico and some aloe juice, as well as some peach gummies and a fidget popper toy (a 3 pack actually, i gave away the other two). good stuff!</p>

	  <p class="caption">oooh, this stuff was good. better than expected. i had to drink it after dinner, though, for reasons i will discuss in a second.</p></div>
	  <p>there is one item i left out though... let me give some context. recently, i have been told that i am a t2 diabetic. it's not really a shock, i have a huge sweet tooth despite knowing that diabetes is very genetic in my family (both sides). basically, i'm a dipshit and im now working to control my sugars. i say this and then buy a bunch of sweets... it's a process.</p>
	  <p>so, the item... a "blood sugar" tea. found completely by chance. i had got lost in the store and glanced up at a shelf, and there it was. and i'm going to be completely honest, i incredibly doubt that this tea is going to help. i just wanted to humor myself. so, i went ahead and picked it up.</p>
	  <p>fast forward to me about an hour ago now. i have been up for hours after laying down for bed. i finally throw in the towel and get up to do something about my insomnia. i decided to make some tea, and i remembered the "blood sugar" tea i had bought the day before.</p>
	  <p>i heat up my water, stick in the tea bag, cover up the cup and scroll through reddit for about 10 minutes. i noticed when i opened up the packet, it smelled... savory. which was interesting, because i had never smelled "savory" tea before. needless to say, i was very curious.</p>
	  <p>i uncover my cup and take a sip... and... it tasted exactly how it smelled. savory. it was like, drinking a soup...</p>
	  <p>now, i didn't dislike it! i actually enjoyed it. but it was new. i loved drinking tea as a kid, but kind of fell out of it in favor of coffee and energy drinks when i began highschool. it was only recently i started drinking tea again (with a much broader selection than i had as a kid, too). basically, in all the tea i've drank in my life, this was brand new. and i liked it.</p>
	  <p>while the intent was to soothe myself to sleep... it actually woke me up and made my focus a bit sharper. weird. maybe i ought to check my sugar soon.</p>
	  <p>i don't think i'm going to bed any time soon. the sun is rising now, so at best i'll probably get a nap in later. i guess now is a good time to make breakfast and start the day.</p>
	  <p>i hope everyone is doing okay. i'm not sure who reads this blog, if anyone, but just in general i hope people are okay. i had this banger in my spotify discover weekly, it's stuck in my head now! take care.</p>
