      <p>so it's the end of the year. quite frankly, i don't want to focus much on it. i can't even remember much of it anyways, as my spoons are currently quite low. instead, i would like to just dump some current thoughts i have tonight. don't expect it to be spectacular, though, as i said... i am low on spoons.</p>

	  <p>so this year i learned i was a type 2 diabetic. it's hard to think of it as not my fault. diabetes does run on both sides of my family, but i could of probably done better to prevent it. i'm getting better at managing it though, i think. next year, i would like to exercise just a tad more. not only does it help my blood sugar, but i feel very content afterwards. i own Ring Fit Adventure now, and i have Just Dance as well, so i have no excuse to not try and move a bit more lol. it will be beneficial in many ways, i think</p>
	  <p>i go on vacation very soon too. i will be going on a cruise with my girlfriend and her parents, as well as her grandparents. don't ask me where, i forget every time... @_@ but we will be departing from florida. this will be <i>the</i> most extravagant experience i'll ever have in my life thus far. i've never been on much of a vacation, not on this scale. and i've never been to the ocean, nor a cruise or a boat at all. this is a lot of firsts for me. i'm nervous, but excited. more nervous, though, unfortunately. i keep having anxious dreams... but i will do my best to have a good time. there is a lot of prep to do, however, and that will keep me busy for the next few days.</p> 
	  <p>i want to try and draw more in the New Year. this year was just... sad. unfortunately this is due to depression, but with managing my blood sugar, that should improve. i need to find a way to get ideas too, i seem to be out of ideas. maybe i just need to branch out a little more with the subjects i draw.</p>
	  <p>well. i've ran out of thoughts. if you actually read this, cool. you get a cookie. i hope you have a good and safe new year's eve, and a good and safe new year. don't go ham on the alcohol, okay? tonight i'm just having flavored water.</p>
	  <p>take care</p>
