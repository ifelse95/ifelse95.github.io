      <p>it's been a long time, huh? lately, when i try to write about my thoughts, i've been feeling some sort of weird "stage fright." i need to work on that.</p>
	  <p>today i want to talk about my day. just to keep it simple and to get back into the swing of writing my thoughts out.</p>
	  <p>today i woke up at about 9ish AM. i was very sleepy, but i managed to not fall back asleep. after all, i had a psychiatry appointment this morning.</p>
	  <p>i was hallucinating very mildly this morning. i don't even remember what i was hearing, actually. it just reminded me to take my meds, which i did.</p>
	  <p>i then got dressed. i found my <i>Spirited Away</i> printed tee and a black skirt, so that's what i decided to go with today. i love rainbows, if you havent guessed yet, but i also love dark colors as well. after all, they're also a part of the color spectrum.</p>
	  <p>I'm pretty much ready to go at this point. I put in my soap bubble earrings and style my hair, grab my bag and head out with my girlfriend's mom (basically my mom in law lol). i can't drive yet, so i must rely on others for transportation, unfortunately. it was at this point when i heard that one of our chickens got snatched up by a hawk, and another had passed. which is strange and saddening, because we just had another beloved chicken pass shortly before.</p>
	  <p>so at this point, the day isnt going well. me and my MIL are bummed, but the show must go on. we pick up breakfast and i head to psychiatry just at the minute mark of when it was scheduled.</p>
	  <p>she raises the dose of my antipsychotics. i find it annoying, because i was talking about how i was fine. she wants my psychosis to completely disappear. i don't think she realizes that it wont completely disappear. and i've made peace with it and accepted it. but, it's whatever.</p>
	  <p>so i left that appointment kinda grumpy, and headed in to get my birth control shot done. i take this because my mental health hits rock bottom when i PMS, among other things. this was... an unexpectedly hard appointment. i won't go into the details today, but i was a bit misty eyed afterwards.</p>
	  <p>so now im really feeling like crap. im tired and i want to go home, but MIL wants to stop at a few places to pick up hawk deterrents. im completely fine with this because fuck hawks (not really but please stop eating our chickens thanks).</p>
	  <p>we go to two stores. a sports and outdoors shop and the dollar store. i made two crow decoys kiss each other at the sports shop and found pokemon cards in abundance at the check out. at the dollar store, i picked up a couple bouquets of fake pink roses for my room. this makes me feel a bit better.</p>
	  <p>we then go to sonic and i get a milkshake. this proved to be a bad idea, because when i got home, took a nap, woke up and checked my blood sugar, it was rather high.</p>
	  <p>curse my sonic milkshake cravings. so i grab my switch, hoping to dear god that it hasn't run out of battery. i turn it on and its JUST on the brink of death so i made a mad dash to the dock and plopped that baby in just in time. then my girlfriend informed me that she heard me run like a mad man across the house. :P</p>
	  <p>anyway, so i decide to play <i>Ring Fit Adventure</i>. man. this game always kicks my ass. i need to play it more often, though. exercising actually gives me more energy and i feel good doing it. often times, my exercising is just taking a walk. as it's now spring, i'll be doing that more often.</p>
		<p>so my ass is thoroughly kicked afterwards. woohoo! i then shower and eat dinner and take my evening meds. aaaand... that takes us to here. hi!</p>
	<p>if you actually read this, props to you. i don't expect me to publicly write about my day often, that's more for my private journal. so it's awesome if you read this.</p> 
	<p>i recently discovered the <a href="https://yesterweb.org/">Yesterweb</a> community, and it's really been a good thing for me. i am thinking about joining the webring, but i think there's more dust i want to clear away around here first before i do that. plus, my best friends have been supportive of my web design and mastering endeavors, so i'm thriving and fortunate to be doing so. </p>
	<p>i hope you have a good and safe day/night. here's a song that's been stuck in my head lately.</p>
