      <p>my blood sugar has been high. completely my fault.</p>
	  <p>so it's been more <i>Ring Fit Adventure</i> for me. i don't mind, it's fun! but holy shit, the squats... please don't make me do any more squats.</p>
	  <p>lol. i actually kinda like the burn. i feel like i'm getting stronger.</p>
	  <p>earlier my blood sugar was in the 300s. i did a bit of Ring Fit and then rested. Drank a lot of water. I was hovering at ~280 now. so, i went for a walk. it was an okay walk, i alerted a shy neighbor of their dog running loose. saw some purple flowers. saw another dog. blasted GAS GAS GAS through my earbuds.</p>
	  <p>that was enough to bring my sugar back down into the green!</p>

	  <p class="caption">i use a freestyle libre 2 CGM. it's great, i don't have to prick my fingers anymore!</p>
	  <p>it's going to go back up when i eat dinner, but we're getting back on the right footing again at least. it's getting nice out here, so i'll definitely be taking more walks. that seems the most effective for me.</p>
	  <p>on another note, today i found an old backup of my old blog posts from when ifelse95.xyz was ifelse95.neocities.org! on my phone, of all places! i regret the odd day i decided to purge everything, so im so happy i found these posts again. i have restored them onto this blog.</p>
	  <p>that's all for today. make sure to take care of yourselves. it's one of the most radical things you can do these days.</p>
	  <p>i've been listening to this while writing;</p>
