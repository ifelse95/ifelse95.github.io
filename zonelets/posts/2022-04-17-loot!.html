      <p>let's get one thing out of the way. i love stuff. i love stuff! i like obtaining objects and things. i'm a materialistic bitch and i'm not afraid to admit it.</p>
      <p>okay, now that's out of the way... yesterday, i had my birthday party (slash easter lunch), and today is easter. i have obtained some stuff this weekend, and i wanna talk about it and show you!</p>
      <p>let's start with the birthday haul. now, my actual birthday is on the 29th of this month, but this year i decided to celebrate with my girlfriend's family. they like to combine holidays and birthdays together to celebrate on one day, so it was mine and my girlfriend's grandpa's birthday plus easter lunch on saturday.</p>
      <div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/781057661349265428/965060298857910293/IMG_2056.jpg" style="height:75%;width:75%;" alt="a bunch of stuffed animals, crystals, candy, and pokemon cards laid out on a rainbow zebra blanket, leaning against a blue wall."><p class="caption">some of this i bought with birthday money, but i still count it.</p></div>
      <p>so what we have here is;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>unicorn beanie boo</li>
        <li>mint axolotl from build-a-bear</li>
        <li>popcorn squishmallow (bought with birthday money)</li>
        <li>wind chime made of wood and agate slices</li>
        <li>dark chocolate bunny</li>
        <li>peppermint gum (bought with birthday money)</li>
        <li>packet of fun sized candy of varying kinds</li>
        <li>a selenite necklace</li>
        <li>a jasper sphere</li>
        <li>a couple of pokemon cards (bought with birthday money)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>along with this, i also got some cash in my birthday cards.</p>
      <p>i love everything. especially the mint axolotl. i've been MANIFESTING this little guy for a while now, so i'm happy to call them mine! no name yet, i'm unfortunately drawing a blank on naming my new stuffies.</p>
      <p>let's move on to today's easter loot. i think this is the first time i've gotten an easter basket since i was really young. it's more like an easter bucket though... regardless, a container is a container.</p>
      <div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/781057661349265428/965369184575950898/IMG_2065.jpg" style="height:75%;width:75%;" alt="a single stuffed animal perched upon an upside down bucket surrounded by candy and a single bath bomb, laid out on a rainbow zebra blanket, leaning against a blue wall."><p class="caption">at first i didn't see all this. it was sitting upon my girlfriend's desk chair.</p></div>
      <p>we got;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>pterodactyl squishmallow eating a slice of pizza</li>
        <li>the blue bucket everything came in</li>
        <li>two packages of sugar free peeps</li>
        <li>a package of blueberry pie snack mix</li>
        <li>a multicolored, egg shaped bath bomb</li>
      </ul>
      <p>i love the pterodactyl... it's so creative. and i loved the treats too. the sugar free peeps were very interesting, as they had a different texture and weren't super sweet. i've yet to use the bath bomb, but maybe i will tonight. and the bucket will get used for... something. not sure yet, but it will get put to use lol.</p>
        <p>sometimes i feel bad for wanting to show off stuff i get or have, because i fear that i might make someone upset or jealous. however, show and tell is kind of one of the ways i communicate with others about myself. i have trouble talking about myself in a straightforward sense, so this is the next best thing.</p>
        <p>plus, people make haul videos on youtube all the time. surely there's an audience for this sort of thing right?</p>
        <p>anyways, that's all for now. i hope you all are having a good day today, wether you celebrate easter or not!</p>
