      <p>i'm telling you, today is just not a good day for masking. i don't know what it is, maybe because i didn't sleep very good, but i just can't seem to act as the world expects me to today.</p>
	  <p>anyways, yesterday i went out into town with my girlfriend. i still had quite a bit of birthday money burning a hole through my pocket, so i wanted to see about getting a new tarot deck.</p>
	  <p>we went to our local metaphysical shop and took a look. as i was looking, my girlfriend ran into a family friend and we talked for a bit. then i picked out a deck that was in spanish.</p>
	  <p>this particular deck called out to me, but i feared that i wouldn't be able to read it. despite this, i bought it along with an abalone shell, figuring that i could make it work somehow. in the end, i ended up doing a reading for myself today with the deck and i could read it just fine.</p>
	  <p>after that short trip, my girlfriend and i decided to walk for a little while before deciding to go to a nearby thrift store.</p>
	  <p>at that thrift store, i found a couple of treasures. for one, i found some vintage barbie dolls. i ended up taking two of them home. i also found a tiny disney digital camera. only for ten bucks, so yeah i was going to take that home and play with it. i might write a separate blog post about that. i also found some cute earrings that were calling my name.</p>
	  <p>and that's pretty much it. here is my haul;</p>

	  <ul>
		<li>tarot cards</li>
		<li>abalone shell</li>
		<li>two vintage barbies</li>
		<li>tiny digital camera</li>
		<li>cute earrings</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>i perched the barbies next to the togedemaru that watches over us in our room. now they also keep watch over us.</p>

	  <p>on a side note, i named my mint axolotl Tobias. it seemed to suit them well. also, there is a constant twinkling in my room now thanks to the fan blowing on the agate wind chime. oh well.</p>
	  <p>that's all for now. i'll hopefully write about something else other than stuff i get next time.</p>
