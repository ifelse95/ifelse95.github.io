      <p>hey, i've been kinda quiet lately. i'll fill you in on what's up.</p>
	  <p>so about two weeks ago i came down with a chest cold. i was getting better as the first week progressed, but then suddenly, my cough got worse. i felt fine otherwise, no fever or anything. so it's definitely not covid (and i know this for fact now, more on that later).</p>
	  <p>i was like okay, alright. i'll let it run it's course. well... it never really did go away. it just kept getting worse. so, i was like, okay then. it was saturday the 23rd, i'll go to the doctor on monday.</p>
	  <p>well, late sunday night, i started struggling to breathe! and i tasted blood in my mouth! so i went to the emergency room. it was there, i learned i had,</p>

	  <p>yep. bronchitis.</p>
	  <p>doctor started me on antibiotics and an inhaler. i broke the news to those i know and they all gave me their support, which i highly appreciate because damn. this fucking sucks.</p>
	  <p>but i am getting better on the antibiotics and inhaler. my cough is less deep now. but during this time, i have been resting more than creating things, understandably. it's funny, usually im always like, "make make make! no time for rest!" but i guess a condition that warranted a trip to the ER made me realize that i really do need rest right now.</p>
	  <p>i'm sure i'll be back on my bullshit here on the site soonish. to relax, i've been getting fresh air and reading my cards. i actually got another new deck recently that i feel like i vibe with well in some weird way.</p>
	  <p>so basically, i'm sick and im recovering. that's all. i'm getting better with each day, and its nothing life threatening, so there's no need to worry. i appreciate those who sent me well wishes.</p>
	  <p>i turn 22 tomorrow. i might blog about that then or a few days after once i've had some time to reflect. until then, here are some tunes. this song has been stuck in my head for days!</p>
