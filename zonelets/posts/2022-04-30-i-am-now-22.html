      <p>i would like to start off by thanking everyone who gave me birthday wishes yesterday. from my best friend group, the yesterweb discord server, and mastodon. thank you. C:</p>
      <p>i think my birthday this year has been great. i kind of celebrated all month, to be honest. i'm not really complaining, it's been fun.</p>
      <p>yesterday, i got my nails done. i don't usually get my nails done, i mostly just paint them myself. i also got my toenails done.</p>
      <div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/781057661349265428/969766353458298970/IMG_2115.jpg" style"height:25%;width:25%;" alt="a hand with it's nails painted mint green"><p class="caption">i got a lot of compliments on these.</p></div>
      <p>then we went to pick up a few things at kohls, so i walked around there for a while and kept accidently ramming the damn cart into displays... that wasn't fun. but yknow what is fun? sushi. we got sushi afterwards.</p>
      <p>then we went home and i relaxed for a bit. i then decided to take a bath with some bathbombs we had got the other day. i used a peach bathbomb. apparently, peaches are associated with longevity and vitality. i think that suits a birthday well.</p>

      <p>so i bathed for a while. made a call to my CGM's manufacturer since i was waiting on a replacement sensor (it turns out "overnight" shipping means in 1 to 2 business days... so i won't be getting my sensor until monday at the latest). washed my hair and face.</p>
      <p>i got out and i kind of forgot what i did for the rest of the day. that night, i had a lovely voice call with my friend. we chatted about different things and it was just really nice to hear their voice. i don't often get to hear it.</p>
      <p>after that i made some tea and designed a character in koikatsu. then i pretty much went to bed.</p>
      <div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/302206873090916354/969842786042007572/Koikatu-2022-04-30-01-08-33-Render.png" style"height:25%;width:25%;" alt="a 3D model of a feminine character. they have long white and rainbow hair, and their face is pitch black with white eyeliner and rainbow irises. their body is a hologram, and they are wearing a rainbow dress. they have large, black, hologram wings"><p class="caption">i love making abominations in games</p></div>
      <p>and that was my 22nd birthday <s>(rather than birth<i>month</i>)</s>. overall, i really had a great time.</p>
      <p>i still cannot beleive i made it this far. my mom keeps telling me im all grown up. i mean, i'm still definitely a kid at heart, but i guess i have done some growing up. and surviving. but i think at this point it's safe to say that i've been living more than anything. and i'm grateful for that. here's to another 22 years of living.</p>
      <p>with that, i leave you with this. have a great and safe day, everyone.</p>
