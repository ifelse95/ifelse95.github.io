      <p>it's been in the 90s in temperature these past few days.</p>
	  <p>after a week of cold and rain, it suddenly got hot. it's been miserable, but at the same time, it makes me long for summer.</p>
	  <p>my sister is supposed to come down for the summer. we have to get moved into our new room in the basement before she comes, but we plan on having lots of fun. including water activities.</p>
	  <p>i've already started some water activities. i've been playing with the water hose outside. rip to my newly washed clothes... i do wonder when the outdoor pool at the local community center opens.</p>
	  <p>i'm excited for summer. it's going to be hot as hell, but i think that's part of the charm.</p>
	  <p>i just wanted to ramble somewhere. thank you if you took the time to read this. here's some tunes.</p>
