      <p>it's a been a little while! i've been kind of busy, and then less busy which caused depression to strike.</p>
	  <p>today i wanted to talk about something i've been playing by myself and with my friends lately. i'm sure you've heard of minecraft. well, we've been playing on java edition with a specific (modified) modpack. it's called Bliss.</p>
	  <div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/781057661349265428/988982368318668850/unknown.png" alt="A logo written in cursive that reads bliss. It has a pink and purple gradient on it."><p class="caption">this is its logo.</p></div>
	  <p>Bliss is a vanilla+, pretty much completely peaceful modded minecraft experience created by Vazkii, designed with relaxation and accessibility in mind. in Bliss there are many biomes to explore, mobs only attack when attacked, there's a wiki in game, and so much more. you can learn more on the <a href="https://bliss.violetmoon.org/">Bliss website</a>!</p>
	  <p>my girlfriend brought it to my attention a week or two ago. i decided to check it out. i ended up loving the modpack to pieces! it was new and unusual to me, having mobs not attack me as i explored the world around me.</p>

I ended up modifying my modpack a bit, adding JourneyMap and AppleSkin.</p></div>
	  <p>i built a house in my single player world near a village. i also tamed a cat. i only ever died twice, and because of dumb reasons. but when i died, a totem of holding held my stuff for me until i returned!</p>

	  <p>after watching me for a little while, my girlfriend held a poll on our friends' discord asking if she should start a Bliss server. in the end, the answers all pointed to yes, so she went ahead and created a server with a modified version of the modpack.</p>
	  <p>so me and my friends have been working on expanding a village we found on the server. when i spawned in, i chopped down a mahogany tree for wood and took its saplings with me.</p>
	  <p>i built a house out of mahogany wood and planted those saplings. over time... i might of grown a whole forest of mahogany trees.</p>

	  <p>we've mostly been collecting resources, building, exploring, etc. there's not really a set goal in mind for us right now, but i think we're fine with it. we just vibe with each other for the most part. and i think we really needed something like that for a while now.</p>
	  <p>that's all i have to talk about for now. my focus isnt very good at the moment, so i hope this wasnt too incoherent. i'll leave you with some extra screenshots.</p>
