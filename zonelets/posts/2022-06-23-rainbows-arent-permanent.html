      <p>i need to get a few things off my chest, and i need to feel like someone is listening. so that's why im posting this publicly.</p>
	  <p>these past few days have been really hard. i've been struggling with a sudden and intense bout of depression, which in turn has been making my psychosis and anxiety spike as well. i think it may be my blood sugar, so i probably need to take a little bit of insulin and eat better. but either way, it's been terrible.</p>
	  <p>i'm not really all that sad. i just feel empty and tired. i feel hopeless that it'll go away, and i don't feel like doing anything productive. i've been playing minecraft with my friends and the sims 4, that helps a bit but it's just a mere distraction in the moment.</p>
	  <p>i'm having some really scary thoughts and seeing some weird things, even though im medicated. i'm trying to hold on for my friends and family, but sometimes i feel like they wouldn't worry if i just disappeared one day.</p>
	  <p>this whole thing is frustrating. but i have to remember something -- this wont last forever.</p>
	  <p>when i brought this up with my therapist, we thought of something to remind me of that notion. i had a stuffed unicorn with me just to have something to hold in my hands, and one symbol we thought of was unicorns. no reason other than to put a face to a name at the moment, but now that i think about it...</p>
	  <p>if i were to stumble upon a unicorn in the wild, how long would it stay there? it might be skittish. or it may just have other plans. or maybe <i>i</i> have other plans. either way, its not going to be a moment that lasts forever, and that's fine.</p>
	  <p>my mom in law brought up another symbol; rainbows. they don't last forever either. the moisture in the air clears up and the colors fade away, and that's fine. it happens.</p>
	  <p>plus, there could be a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. who knows. and for unicorns, i feel like they make me hopeful. both of these things are things i enjoy, and they can bring me positivity in these dark times.</p>
	  <p>so, i just need to push through. take better care of my health and take each day at a time.</p>
	  <p>i have people who care about me. one of my best friends told me they felt safe with me, and i don't want to take that away from them. another one of my best friends is happy i used the snack crate in our minecraft server, and i want to keep cooking food for everyone. my girlfriend likes to goof off with me, and i dont want her to be alone.</p>
	  <p>if you actually read this, thank you. here's some tunes to send you off on your way.</p>
