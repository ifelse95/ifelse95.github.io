      <p>im... very caffeinated right now. i didn't mean to get this way, but i am. anyways, onto the post</p>
	  <p>ive officially completed two weeks of college! but it's not time to celebrate yet. i need to make it to three weeks and then so, then i'll celebrate.</p>
	  <p>so... i'll just tell you about how things are going. things are going great! my professors and classes are awesome, except for one which i had to drop for this semester. i am currently majoring in *ahem* Web Development &amp; Digital Design, as well as Liberal Arts. i am taking HTML &amp; CSS, Javascript I, and Elementary Japanese I (from here on out, i may be practicing my hiragana). i am also in my college's GSA and i'm considering joining the club for latinos.</p>
	  <p>HTML &amp; CSS has been super easy to pick up, with a few strange things here and there. like putting a line break in the middle of a paragraph.</p>
	  <div align="center"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/781057661349265428/1015418938298998804/Capture.PNG" alt="<p>Like this. Here is a line. <br> Here is another.</p>"></div>
	  <p>but besides that, its been fairly easy and the info seems to be sticking. although, it appears this course teaches as if you're building a site for a company. which i expected to a degree. it's just kind of boring. i initially started a site as a hobby project, a place to have fun and express myself. but alas, we live in a cooporate world where that isn't allowed, apparently. but if i want a career in this, i better learn to accept it.</p>
	  <p>Elementary Japanese I was been a much needed challenge. it's a difficult language, and im struggling to learn my hiragana, but i have an 84% in the class so far so i must be doing something right. im actually a little behind, which im going to take the next 5 days to catch up for. my professor is very nice, she gave me a long extension on my homework and said i could take today's quiz next week. she's also actually japanese, so im super nervous with my speaking around her lol. im trying to get over it.</p>
	  <p>i havent taken Javascript I yet... it actually starts next week after the long weekend. so i'll tell you later how that goes.</p>
	  <p>i think i'm doing well so far. i've made friends and i find it's easier to socialize in person when im around other adults (roughly) my age. i even had a couple of them check out my website. one wouldn't leave it, and it made me very flustered lol (you know who you are, if you decide to check my blog)</p>
	  <p>unfortunately... i have to rely on caffeine to get me going. but like, i guess who doesn't rely on caffeine these days? at the same time, however... it's not ideal sometimes. i've also started taking cbg/cbd gummies today, and i think that's playing with the caffeine ive had today and is supercharging me. on tuesday i'll skip the energy drink and try just a gummy and see how it goes. i dont have much anxiety at least!</p>
	  <p>im just happy to be doing something with my life again. if i could afford it, i'd go to school forever.</p>
	  <p>on an unrelated note, you should follow me on tumblr. i've been using it again lately. im <a href="https://ifelse95.tumblr.com/">ifelse95</a> on there, and started writing more short-form posts there.</p>
	  <p>im going to chug water now. have a safe day/night</p>
