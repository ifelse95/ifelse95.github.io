<p>ive been up all night due to pain and racing thoughts, so i know its been storming.</p>

<p>well, out of the blue at about 6:30 AM, an enormous lightning strike hits. it takes out our entire room, both UPSes failing. the wii, the flatscreen, both of our computers, everything went out. i wouldn't be surprised if the rest of the house was affected as well.</p>

<p>it only lasted for a moment, power being restored to one UPS and thus everything connected to it. however, the other UPS didn't power back on and is now clicking.</p>

<p>i checked my computer after plugging it into a wall outlet, it was fine. have yet to check the other computer. it might be okay.</p>

<p>usually i'd write something this long on my website, but im not willing to risk my computer again like that. plus, the wifi hasn't come back yet. i might end up mirroring this post over there later today if it stops storming.</p>

<h2>update at 8:42 PM</h2>

<p>the storm ended at about 8 am. my girlfriend's dad came down (nearly scaring the shit out of me in the process) and rebooted the servers. servers and internet came back, but now the UPS that was clicking was making a periodic beeping noise. i fell asleep at some point and woke up to it being gone, so my girlfriend must of done something. her computer survived, by the way.</p>

<p>thank you for reading. life hasnt been kind to me lately, but im surviving. maybe i'll write an update later. stay safe for now.</p>
