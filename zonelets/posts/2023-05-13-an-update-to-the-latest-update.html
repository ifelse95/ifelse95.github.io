      <p>i'm awake when i could be sleeping a bit more before my 7 hour trip home today, and i reread <a href="https://www.ifelse95.xyz/zonelets/posts/2023-05-09-im-cringe-but-free.html">my latest life update post</a>. i wanted to talk a little more about it, my plurality especially.</p>
	  
	  <p>it's been a couple days since that post. a lot has happened. i joined a plural specific discord server with the tumblr mutual(s) and friend(s), who helped me figure out i was plural in the first place. janice started getting steady on her feet again and fronting, discovering new things about life like the joys of making spotify playlists and eating chocolate and honey. we're seeing the inside of our brain better. so much has happened, but everything that has happened has been positive.</p>
	  
	  <p>we have been utilizing tools like <a href="https://pluralkit.me/">Pluralkit</a> and Simply Plural and they have been very helpful. we thought about using Tupperbox, since we already used it for SBARGv2.5 and other RP. but we figured it was best to keep my ocs and my headmates separate.</p>
	  
	  <p>there are 4 of us now. Janice (she/her), Eli (he/him), Patchouli (they/them), and me, Cyrus (they/them, but you knew that already). for the time being, we aren't too concerned about memeber roles. we have concluded, though, that we're some form of <a href="https://pluralpedia.org/w/Mixed_Origin">mixed-origin</a>, <a href="https://pluralpedia.org/w/Endogenic">endogenic</a> system (trauma, neurodivergence, schizoaffective, etc. links go to Pluralpedia). i picked both of these terms because i feel like they both suit us.</p>
	  
	  <p>so far we have been very peaceful and we all get along. a much welcomed change compared to my system when i was younger. my headmates are a little shy sometimes, but that's really it. otherwise, we're all chill and pretty content.</p>
	  
	  <p>as for my alterhumanity, yes. i, cyrus, still feel nonhuman and nothing is going to change that for as long as i have this brain. i get that physically, i am a human being that breathes and bleeds and can die at any time. otherwise, however, not so much.</p>
	  
	  <p>well, that's all i have to say. i better upload this real quick and pack my laptop away so i can say my goodbyes to my mom and sister and head to the airport. thank you for reading!</p>
