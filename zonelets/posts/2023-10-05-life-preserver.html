      <p>hey, it's cyrus. i did say on possum.city that <a href="https://possum.city/notes/9jbsxcrqoaf7wmfb">i was going to write a doll related post</a> here. then i said i <a href="https://possum.city/notes/9k5en9otw2v4wfd5">scrapped it</a>. and i did. but here i am making a <em>different</em> doll related post. it's about why i started collecting in the first place.</p>
	  
	  <p>let's start with some of the more basic reasons. first of all, i just like dolls. i always have, ever since we were a kid. secondly, i think they're cute and pretty. thirdly, i'm a toy collector. dolls are toys and i am drawn to them as a result.</p>
	  
	  <p>okay, those were boring. now, let's get into the bigger reasons.</p>
	  
	  <p>ever since we were a child, we've struggled with depression. many factors play into why and how, but i'm not going to get into that here today. we started medication when we were a teenager. to this day, none of them have helped at all or they have helped very little. therapy has helped a bit, we have been in therapy since we were a child. but other than that, living has been kind of... horrible.</p>
	  
	  <p>i'm coming to terms with the fact that our depression may be treatment resistant. being alive is sorrowful for me, and every day i wish i could somehow disappear without upsetting anyone. there's absolutely no reason for me to feel this way. i have friends, i have two wonderful partners, i have cats, i have my mom and my sibling... but yet, i still cry often. i still have thoughts of suicide. i still hurt. its still hard for me to get out of bed. its hard to function.</p>
	  
	  <p>when i think of my dolls, i think of them as something to look forward to. and when i have something to look forward to, it makes being alive a little easier. it makes things hurt less. its motivating.</p>
	  
	  <p>when i got into the hobby, i didn't expect to enjoy it so much. which is kinda silly now that i think about it.</p>
	  
	  <p>posing them, playing with their hair, looking at them... these dolls have kept me alive a little longer. i once talked myself out of suicide because "what if there aren't dolls afterwards?" and it's honestly kind of pathetic. i'll readily admit that.</p>
	  
	  <p>but you know what? when it comes to a point where every medicine you have taken has done no good for you, and when it comes to a point where every single day you have the thought of dying at least at the back of your head... you take what you can get, to survive.</p>
	  
	  <p>i want to survive. i have plans for the future. i need to survive.</p>
	  
	  <p>so, that's one big reason i collect. it literally keeps me alive.</p>
	  
	  <p>my other big reason is the creativity these dolls spark in me. when i first got my Rainbow High Gabriella Icely doll, i remember posing her and taking many photos of her. putting her in a little scenario, snap a shot. and i still do this with my other dolls today.</p>
	  
	  <p>not only that, but their fashion also inspires me. i love fashion, so its natural that fashion dolls are the focal point of my collection. the hair and makeup have inspired me to experiment with our own.</p>
	  
	  <p>and do you why this is important to me? because depression has taken most of my creativity away from me. yep, it goes back to depression. since i've started collecting, i have been feeling more creative and more motivated to make things. like this post.</p>
	  
	  <p>so, that's my other big reason.</p>
	  
	  <p>with fall being here and winter soon to follow, my depression is going to worsen. so i'm trying to hang on however i can. maybe it doesn't matter to you, but i do have people who love me and would be shattered if i passed too soon. plus, i wouldn't just have my own blood on my hands, but also my headmates'.</p>
	  
	  <p>thank you for reading if you did. no music today because this was just supposed to be a quick thing to write while the idea was still in my head. maybe i'll finish the doll collection post sometime.</p>
