	  <p>it's been... so long since i've written to our Zonelets blog. i just havent felt motivated lately. however... that obviously changed!</p>
	  <p>we as a system decided to begin Vtubing! we have been thinking about this for a very long time, and it's finally being put into motion. the ultimate goal of us Vtubing is to help us develop social skills, speak better, and overcome our shyness.</p>
	  <p>it was kind of a rocky process of preparing. life has been weird lately; between visiting our family, trying to figure out what we want to do in life, me being very frontstuck, being hospitalized three times in a row in the span of like 6 months (twice in DKA and once in sepsis)... its been hard. but things are starting to look up.</p>
	  <p>with that being all said, i'd like to introduce you to our avatar!</p>

	  <p>their name is just ifelse95. they use they/them pronouns, and they are a plural system representing our system. below is a video of some progress making them and testing them.</p>

	  <p>yeah im gonna be honest, i paused writing this to put together that video and i've lost my train of thought. #adhd</p>
	  <p>we plan to stream variety content on Twitch and Joystick (SFW and NSFW respectively). as for when we debut... we're not sure yet. we still have some wrinkles to iron out and we want to make sure we're prepared for our first stream. we'll keep you posted in the meantime.</p>
	  <p>we're very excited to go on this path. i hope you will have us. thank you for reading.</p>
